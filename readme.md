Machine Learning with Dex and Lenses
====================================

This implements the ideas in the paper 
[Categorical Foundations of Gradient-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01931) by Gavranovic, Ghani, Wilson, and Zanasi.
They provide an [implementation in python](https://github.com/lics2021-submission-208/code).
Since Dex is a typed functional language with automatic differentiation and an emphasis on machine learning, I thought it would be a good fit.

This is just an attempt to understand the idea by implementing them.
The code is not in a state where it can be used for anything meaningful.
